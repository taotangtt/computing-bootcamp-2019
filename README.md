- Recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address, featuring a brief discussion of case studies gone wrong and how reproducible research could have possibly helped
- Identify pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible
- The role of documentation, sharing, automation, and organization in making your research more reproducible
- Introduce some tools to solve these problems, specifically R / RStudio / R Markdown

## Organizing your project to facilitate reproducible research

- Organize projects and folders to enable reproducibility and reusability
- Understand the structure of data files and the importance of documenting all changes made
- Create a reproducible project workflow using R / RStudio / R Markdown

## Version control
